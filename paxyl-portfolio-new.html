Paxyl delivers a variety of contact center solutions using the most high-performance software and technologies on the market.</p>

			<h1 class="explanation-header">WEBSITE REDESIGN AND CODING</h1>
			<p class="explanation-text">While I was responsible for designing their new print marketing materials on a contract basis, Paxyl also decided to hire me to redesign and code their new responsive website. This was going to be the first responsive website that I entirely did from scratch (research, wireframes, design, mockups, HTML-CSS coding and integration with git hub).</p>
		</div>	


		<div>
			<h1 class="explanation-header">OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS</h1>
			<p class="explanation-text">Paxyl was and still is a growing Canadian company. In recent years they have acquired major accounts with Bell Canada, Air Canada, Videotron, Hydro Quebec, Pepsi and many others. Paxyl needed a website that better represented their qualifications and expertise. It needed to demonstrate that it is now able to play in the major leagues. The new design was first and foremost to attract more high-technology companies.</p>

			</div>

		<div>
			<h1 class="explanation-header">PROCESS</h1>
			<p class="explanation-text">The 3 months redesigned experience for Paxyl was realized using Sketch software, coding was done in Sublime Text and the integration with git hub. For the first month, I had 5 meetings with the president and his two associates to discuss business goals, analyse their needs, create sketches, wireframes and user flows.</p> 

			<p class="explanation-text">Once approved, I started designing a high-class/high-tech design while keeping in mind their previous colors and logos that the company wanted to keep. Two mockup pages were presented to the client for approval before going further (2 pages for each: mobile, tablet and desktop). They were presented in person on a computer, to gather a better feedback and sense of their reactions and needs. The final mockups were presented using the Sketch software and Invision for prototype animation.</p>

			<h1 class="explanation-header">CHALLENGES AND RESULTS</h1>
			<p class="explanation-text">After presenting the final mockups for approval, in a last meeting, we realized that the home page was missing something. The client wanted an index page with more impact.</p> 

			<p class="explanation-text">We decided to add a caroussel of 3 images, that would create an emotion with spectacular abstract hi-tech images. I knew this add to be coded in Javascript, a language I have not learned yet. But with web research, I was able to integrate it in the final design and was able to easily add the code to the index page. This was a last minute change, but the final design was highly improved and the client impressed.</p></div>
